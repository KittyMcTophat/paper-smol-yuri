\* Note that I said "inspired", not "perfectly copied with 100% accuracy". If I get even one message saying that Paper Mario didn't use cubes, I will lose my shit.

\*\* Batteries, smol or otherwise, are not included.

\*\*\* Hypothetically, if batteries of any kind were to be included, they'd be included "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
